## Welcome to GitHub Pages

[editor on GitHub](https://github.com/magrathj/Pyspark-Docker-Image-With-Azure-Gen2-Connection/edit/gh-pages/index.md) 

Setting up spark locally can be a bit of a faff, especially when trying to then connect to external data stores like Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS). 

To simplify this, I've put together a docker image with Pyspark and a Azure Gen2 storage connection. This way developers can build spark applications on their local machines, then deploy those applications on to compute engine like Databrick or Kubernetes.
